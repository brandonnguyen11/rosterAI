    "bodyText": "NFL.com Analyst Former NFL player and scout Bucky Brooks knows the ins and outs of this league, providing keen insight in his notebook. Today's installment covers: But first, a look at one coordinator who appears poised for a seat in the big chair ... The NFL coaching carousel has not started spinning, but expect Jeff Hafley to have a premium spot on it when owners and executives start discussing hot candidates for the 2026 cycle. The former Boston College head coach and current Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator can step into any job interview with an intriguing rÃ©sumÃ©. Having run a well-respected program in a Power Four conference for four years, Hafley understands the demands of being the head honcho. The defensive-minded coach has delicately balanced operating as a CEO while also crafting schematic solutions to stifle a wide array of offensive attacks at the collegiate level. Granted, he wasn't shy about voicing his frustrations with the increasing off-field demands for college coaches, something that clearly played a role in his departure from BC. But the responsibilities of an NFL head coach are much more focused than those of a college HC. In this league, the job is \"all about ball\" and managing the relationships that make the X's and O's come to life. From building and maintaining a championship culture to crafting a comprehensive three-phase plan (offense, defense and special teams) that enables a team to master the art of playing complementary football, NFL head men spend the bulk of their time on the on-field product, as opposed to fighting recruiting battles and closing NIL deals. Since Hafley took the reins of the Packers' defense in January of 2024, the coach has earned high marks for his work with a unit that underachieved through most of the Aaron Rodgers era in Green Bay. The 46-year-old coach is getting the most out of a collection of former first-round picks, turning them into a turnover-obsessed group that excels in a \"see ball, get ball\" scheme. As a vision-and-break enthusiast who prefers zone coverage over man-to-man -- because defenders can react quicker when they have their eyes on the quarterback -- Hafley has been able to position his designated playmakers in spots that enable them to snag interceptions on tipped or overthrown passes. Green Bay tied for third in the NFL with 17 interceptions last season. Star safety Xavier McKinney led the way with eight picks, ranking second in the NFL (Kerby Joseph had nine) and earning him first-team All-Pro honors. Additionally, under Hafley, the Packers have a knack for forcing fumbles when defenders deliver \"bang-bang\" shots on pass catchers venturing into their zone. Considering the outsized impact of turnovers on game outcomes, Green Bay's decision to play more zone coverage under Hafley has paid off spectacularly, leading to more game-changing plays from a group of defenders who are flying to the ball with reckless abandon. The Packers' superior front-line personnel has also played a significant role in the unit's increased takeaways. Before Micah Parsons' arrival via trade, Rashan Gary led the charge off the edge as a freakish combination of size, strength and athleticism, while Devonte Wyatt, Karl Brooks and Edgerrin Cooper chipped in as complementary pass rushers. Now, with Parsons in the mix as an elite game-wrecker, all of those players benefit. A Pro Bowler in each of his first four NFL campaigns, Parsons commands significant attention as a disruptive force with unique skills as an edge rusher or off-ball blitz specialist. His combination of speed and power overwhelms blockers, forcing opponents to utilize double-teams or chip strategies to slow him down. With so much attention on one player, the rest of the Packers have been able to run through creases on the simulated pressures (four-man rushes with a second-level defender as the fourth rusher) and five-man blitzes. And this elevates the play of Packers beyond the guys listed above. Defensive end Lukas Van Ness, a first-round pick in 2023 who'd yet to live up to his draft pedigree, is showing more promise with Parsons in the fold. Hafley's ability to maximize talented players within his scheme (SEE: Parsons and McKinney) speaks to his adaptability as a schemer. He understands how to build around the strengths of his top players while minimizing the deficiencies of his role players within the same scheme. While there is no direct correlation between success as a coordinator and effectiveness as a head coach, Hafley's experience and expertise would help him thrive if he were to receive a head-coaching gig. And that's something that appears to be in the offing very soon. Yes, the Packers (2-1) just suffered a shocking defeat in Cleveland, but don't blame Hafley. His defense gave up just 13 points (yielding one touchdown on a 4-yard \"drive\" following a Jordan Love interception) and 221 total yards. And the Pack completely stifled Detroit and Washington -- two of the best offenses in the league last year -- during the first two weeks of this season. Green Bay will be in a bright spotlight this Sunday night, with the Packers visiting the Cowboys in Parsons' highly anticipated return to Dallas. With the football world closely monitoring Hafley's work for a contender, the former Boston College head coach could get another chance to wear the big whistle in a few months. Russell Wilson's benching this week was hardly a surprise, given the 36-year-old quarterback's overall play during New York's 0-3 start to the year. But I understand why the team waited a bit before turning to first-round pick Jaxson Dart, even after his stellar preseason. By listing Dart behind Wilson on the depth chart and limiting him to a handful of snaps in the first three weeks, the Giants were clearly trying to do right by the prospect, giving him a chance to acclimate to the pro game while they ramped up his reps and prepared him for the leading role. \"I don't think any rookie quarterback is ever just ready to play,\" Daboll told reporters at a press conference announcing the quarterback change. \"You put him in there because you think that he's done enough to show you that he can go out there and compete, and he's done that every step of the way. And that's why I made the decision.\" That said, after reviewing the All-22 coaches film from Dart's preseason performances, it is easy to see how he could jump-start this struggling attack. The Ole Miss product is a dual-threat playmaker with the arm talent, athleticism and moxie to thrive in a system that meshes collegiate concepts with traditional pro-style tactics. Whether he's executing RPOs (run-pass options), designed quarterback runs or movement-based concepts (bootlegs and sprint-outs), or dropping dimes on quick-rhythm throws between the numbers, Dart's rapid release and superb diagnostic skills enable him to swiftly distribute the ball to his playmakers on the perimeter before the defense can react to myriad flash fakes and misdirection actions in the backfield. Additionally, Dart's athleticism and mobility allow him to improvise when opponents blanket his initial reads or apply enough pressure to force him out of the pocket. His impromptu playmaking ability will add another dimension to New York's offense, giving the Giants more answers against the league's ultra-aggressive defenses. In terms of talent and athletic gifts, Dart is not quite on the level of Josh Allen, whom Daboll helped transform into a star while serving as the Bills' offensive coordinator -- but Dart does flash similar traits as a mobile playmaker. From his ability to find creases on option plays and designed quarterback runs to his improvisational skills outside of the pocket, Dart is the kind of dynamic force around whom Daboll can build, with the potential to elevate the weapons in his supporting cast. With Dart joining rookie RB Cam Skattebo and second-year WR Malik Nabers, the Giants' newest set of triplets is comprised of explosive playmakers ideally suited to play in an RPO attack that puts constant pressure on opposing Ds. These exciting talents will enable the team to utilize more movement-based concepts and vertical shots off various play fakes, creating more big-play opportunities for an offense attempting to find its identity. This league is all about matchups and systems. Pairing Dart with a forward-thinking head coach/offensive architect should unlock parts of the Giants' attack that we have not seen since Daboll took over in 2022. Yes, I know Daboll already had some early success in New York with an athletic quarterback (Daniel Jones), but the coach has not yet been able to deploy some of the tricks and gadgets that made his Bills offense pop with Allen under center. Dart certainly doesn't have an easy assignment this Sunday, making his starting debut against the 3-0 Chargers. Jim Harbaugh and Jesse Minter once again have one of the league's stingiest defenses. But I'm excited to see how he settles in during the coming weeks, running a system that utilizes some of the concepts that helped him play well enough at Ole Miss to become the 25th overall pick in April's draft. The team's new franchise quarterback could help Daboll showcase his offensive wizardry and QB development skills over the 14 games that remain in 2025, thus proving he should stay on as HC into 2026. The dynamic kickoff has changed the way special teams coaches are approaching an aspect of the game that had decreased in importance prior to last season's implementation of the new format. Before this season, the league tweaked the rules -- moving touchbacks from the 30-yard line to the 35 -- in hopes of increasing the rate of returns. So far, so good. Now, kickers are combating the surge in returns with a strategic technique that discombobulates returners. The \"dirty kick,\" as it's coming to be known, is a squib kick into the landing zone (the area between the receiving team's goal line and its 20-yard line) that bounces and rolls around, forcing returners to field the ball like a fast-moving grounder in an MLB infield. The unpredictable bounces test the hand-eye coordination of returners, while also disrupting the timing and rhythm of the blocking scheme. As a result, returners are unable to find creases in the coverage, leading to minimal gains and routine tackles inside the 20-yard line. In last week's Rams-Eagles game, Los Angeles kicker Joshua Karty effectively utilized the dirty kick to completely disrupt Philadelphia's return game. The combination of a knuckleball kick, random bounces and aggressive coverage had Eagles returners in hell, giving the Rams' defense a significant advantage before each Philly drive even began. Moreover, this forced the Eagles to scour the waiver wire for a returner (Xavier Gipson) with the talent, temperament and tools to fix their return woes. It's safe to assume the rest of the league is studying the Rams' kickoff reel to steal an idea that could become a difference-maker in a league where field position increasingly matters. Given Karty's success, we're sure to see more squibs and pop-ups that befuddle returners and tilt this special teams battle in the kicking team's favor.

    "bodyText": "Reporter In our Week 2 installment of The Fit Files: NFL's Five Best-Dressed, leading vote-getter -- and New York Jets QB -- Tyrod Taylor showed he has just as much earned experience in the fashion game as he does on the field. This week, defense strikes back; that side of the ball nabbed its first crown of the year with a young stylish edge rusher and produced three total members of our top five. Before we dig into the list, here's a quick refresher on the members of our panel: Terron Armstead -- Former five-time Pro Bowl left tackle for the Saints and Dolphins (2013-2024); currently hosts The Set podcast on YouTube bi-weekly on Monday/Thursday night. Jamie Erdahl -- Host of Good Morning Football on NFL Network and the nationally syndicated show GMFB OT. Jason McCourty -- Super Bowl champion and former cornerback for the Titans, Browns, Patriots and Dolphins (2009-2021); current ESPN studio analyst/CBS game analyst. Chad Johnson -- Custom clothier and designer for Duane & Johnson menswear tailoring. And finally, I am a national TV reporter for NFL Network, and my fashion vision is: Dress how you want to be addressed and wear what helps you exude, \"I'm HIM.\" A NOTE ON METHODOLOGY: Panelists voted on a list of fits shown off before games from Thursday through Monday, with five points being assigned to each first-place vote, four-points being assigned to each second-place vote, and so on. For players who have previously earned votes, we will list their season point total and mark any prior top-five finishes. Here, presented in reverse order, are the winners from Week 3: Points: 6 Moore would not be out of place shredding a solo onstage in this rock-star get-up, which led Erdahl, who voted him No. 1, to praise him for \"getting us beyond ready for Halloween, head to toe.\" Between complementing his attire with a Jim Irsay tribute guitar and nabbing a pick-six off Tennessee Titans QB Cam Ward hours later, it was Moore's day. NOTE: Moore's fit was styled and designed by Fit Files panelist Chad Johnson, who was ineligible to vote for his client, and other panelists were not aware of his role in the outfit before the vote. And still, Moore made the top five with this custom cropped Navy wool double-breasted jacket with a white cotton silk, Duane & Johnson washed denim straight-leg jeans and black Celine loafers. Points: 7 Burns' leather jacket flows well with white button-up, black woven Bottega tie, black woven Getaway bag and indigo jeans. It's simple yet upscale pop. Johnson added: \"It's the subtle matching that all pairs perfectly. This is the 2025 Denzel Washington airport look.\" Points: 9 Week 3's big hot fashion trend continues as Samuel rocks a green jacket paired with a white button-up shirt, pop red tie, light blue denim jeans, brown boots and bag. Samuel elevates a fit that feels relatable and accessible -- and is still a clear standout. Points: 11 Sometimes, a statement piece has as much to do with its message as it does with unique style. Brown's custom green short-sleeve had \"Check on your teammates\" stitched in yellow thread, along with an \"AJ\" monogram. It paired well with beige pants and black loafers. It was also in keeping with Brown's efforts to spread awareness about the importance of prioritizing mental health, including his decision four years ago to publicly share his own history of depression and thoughts of suicide, and how his former college teammate Elijah Moore helped save his life. In a world of millionaires chasing wins and respect on the field, with fans often relying on them for their fantasy football teams, Brown's use of fashion to remind us to care for one another was one of the most important things we saw in Week 3. Points: 12 Phillips told me that with a short week -- Miami played Buffalo on Thursday Night Football -- he had to scramble a little bit, due to time. He scrapped his original outfit vision of academia vibes, which would have featured a long-sleeve shirt and tie and oversized jacket. Instead, Phillips went into his closet for this Song for the Mute black jacket with a distressed raised floral pattern that he wore once months ago and forgot about. He paired it for the first time with its matching set pants, Prada sunglasses, Maison Margiela Tabi loafers and a wallet chain. \"It was giving Men in Black business professional-type vibes,\" Phillips told me. Great choice. It won the top spot in the latest edition of the Fit Files and serves as a perfect example of high-end fashion being more than a one-time wear. Three different panelists had Phillips in their top five, including McCourty, who gave him his first-place vote. \"Fashion to me is having a vision for a certain vibe,\" Phillips told me. \"Figure out your category first -- maybe you want elevated and professional, maybe cozy. Then freak it your own way to make it personal. It's all about expression. I don't fit in a box in fashion or life. I aim to always show that.\" Just missed the cut: D'Andre Swift (5 points), Keenan Allen (4), DeVonta Smith (3), Charles Omenihu (3), Julian Love (3), Quentin Lake (3), Sean McVay (2), Kendrick Bourne (2), Jordan Phillips (2), DeForest Buckner, Jonathan Owens, Dax Hill. Does Tyrod Taylor own the NFL's best closet? Did Kyler Murray's vintage look ring true? Cameron Wolfe and his panel of style mavens rank the best fits from Week 2. Which game-day fits flashed the most in Week 1 of the NFL season? Cameron Wolfe convenes a panel of fashion-minded observers to identify the five best-dressed figures."

    "bodyText": "Lead Draft Writer If you were hoping for continuity in the Power Rankings, this edition isn't for you. No part of the league hierarchy is above scrutiny after a week when everything was seemingly thrown into the blender. The Packers shockingly lost in Cleveland. The Jets nearly stunned the Buccaneers. Carolina blanked Atlanta, 30-zilch. The Colts remained white hot. The Texans lost another one. Then came the Monday night statement, with the Lions out-Ravening the Ravens at Baltimore in a terrific all-around performance from Detroit. Dan Campbell's group isn't going anywhere. Oh, and there were four blocked field-goal tries across the league on Sunday, two of which were run back for touchdowns and all of which occurred at critical points in the fourth quarter. The Rams-Eagles instant classic provided us with two of those swats and Jordan Davis' epic return. Just batty stuff. But it wasn't all fun and games. Last week, quarterbacks were struck hard by injuries. This week, it was all-world edge rusher Nick Bosa and two former Pro Bowl running backs going down for the season and weakening three contenders. Naturally, there was some serious shuffling of the NFL pecking order. As always, I recommend trying not to get too hung up on how many spots a team moved up or down. The Power Rankings are a two-way street, my friends, and everyone is moving all at once. But if you're still mad about your favorite team's placement, social media remains a fine place to rip me to shreds. Kindly. NOTE: Up/down arrows below reflect movement from the Week 3 Power Rankings. Yes, I did consider making a change at the very top -- flip-flopping Philadelphia and Buffalo -- for the first time this season. And yes, I am aware other Power Rankings pulled that lever. But with the Bills needing to scrap their way to victory over winless Miami, and following the Eagles' rousing comeback against the Rams, I just couldn't do it. Hearing Jalen Hurts talk after the game to Pam Oliver convinced me to keep the order as is: \"If that doesn't show you what type of team we are, I don't know what does,\" Hurts said. He also made an important point about the Eagles showing everyone who they were offensively in the second half. At halftime, they had 33 yards on 22 plays, the worst first half of offense in the Nick Sirianni era. Then, on the second snap of the second half, the Eagles fumbled it away inside their own 10-yard line. That's how you fall behind 26-7 at home. But for the final 29 game minutes, Philly outscored L.A. 26-nothing, clamping down on defense and special teams and ringing up three long TD drives in four tries. This team just knows how to win games, with a fourth-and-goal TD and a blocked kick at the buzzer epitomizing that clutch gene. The offense was methodical and effective against the Dolphins but really lacked a big-play element in the passing game, something that lingered a bit from the Jets game. Defensively, Buffalo also kept the door open for Miami to steal a win by allowing 10-of-15 third-down conversions. In the end, the Bills made enough plays and are earning a reputation as closers, having grown some thicker skin in the past few years. There's also no real reason to panic, given that their next three opponents before the Week 7 bye (New Orleans, New England and Atlanta) all lost Sunday and have a combined two victories. The Bills will receive some defensive line reinforcements after the bye with Michael Hoecht and Larry Ogunjobi coming off suspension, and we could see rookie CB Maxwell Hairston (currently on injured reserve with a knee injury) prior to that point. Those should be some welcome additions to the defense. I think we can bury any coordinator concerns about John Morton and Kelvin Sheppard here and now. The Lions were the tougher, smarter and better-prepared team on Monday night, repeatedly coming up with clutch plays in a hostile road environment. The Lions delivered the first punch. The Ravens countered, landing a few haymakers, too. But Detroit never came close to shriveling up, playing exceptional three-phase football and essentially beating the Ravens at their own game. Four rushing TDs in Baltimore? Seven sacks of Lamar Jackson? Three-for-three on fourth down? Elevated stuff, borne out of coaching and preparation. There were a dozen players I could highlight, but please, out of respect to Morton and Sheppard -- who each called a brilliant game in the MNF spotlight -- can we now end the Ben Johnson/Aaron Glenn questions? That narrative is dead. The Chargers are 3-0 for the first time since 2002, and most importantly, they are also 3-0 in the division with wins over each of their AFC West rivals, giving them a huge early edge in the race. All three victories have come in competitive games, with the Chargers more outlasting their opponents than anything else. Sunday's win over Denver also came at a cost, with Najee Harris suffering a season-ending Achilles injury. The Bolts' struggles to run the ball were already anathema to the typical DNA of a Jim Harbaugh team. Now, the onus is on first-rounder Omarion Hampton, who had a good second half vs. the Broncos, to be the bell cow from here on out. But as long as Los Angeles has Justin Herbert and these passing-game weapons, this team has a shot. Herbert's late TD throw to Keenan Allen is about as good a play as you'll see a QB make this season. After entering the fourth quarter with a three-score lead over the winless Jets at home, the Buccaneers found themselves clinging to a six-point edge at the two-minute warning. A 43-yard field goal would have essentially put the game on ice, but the Bucs apparently needed a bit more drama in their lives. New York blocked the kick and ran it back for a score. Suddenly, Tampa Bay was trailing. Baker Mayfield and the offense got the job done in the end, setting up the game-winning field goal, but the breakdowns that led up to that point were numerous. The Bucs allowed the Jets and backup QB Tyrod Taylor to drive 80 and 73 yards for fourth-quarter touchdowns and settled for too many field goals on offense, going 1-for-5 in the red zone. The Jets nearly shocked the Steelers in Week 1, and the Bucs were lucky they were not victimized. Their late offensive execution was clutch again, but this should have been a statement victory with the way things trended in the second and third quarters. No sugar-coating it: That was easily one of the worst -- and strangest -- losses of Matt LaFleurâs career. The Packers were looking to ice the game on Brandon McManusâ short field-goal try with less than 30 seconds left in a tie game. That cannot turn into a loss in regulation, but somehow it did. The floodgates opened after Jordan Loveâs awful interception, inviting a host of questions about whether this offense has what it takes to make the Packers Super Bowl contenders. Love was under heavy pressure all game, taking five sacks against a very good Browns defense. Zach Tom and Aaron Banks both left the game with injuries, and Green Bay has to find some blocking answers up front. But still, the breakdowns were too glaring to ignore, even if the Pack had pulled this game out. Another Derrick Henry fumble in the fourth quarter helped sink Baltimore, with Aidan Hutchinson's textbook punchout spearheading a splashy night from Detroit's defense. Lamar Jackson was sacked seven times, kept in check as a runner and turned away on a 4th-and-goal from the 2-yard line. There were plenty of mistakes on offense, but the defense was the bigger concern, as the Ravens were unable to hem in the Lions' run game and bring down ball-carriers on first contact. You could argue this game was decided by tackling, with Detroit vastly superior in that department. Granted, Baltimore's defense didn't have Kyle Van Noy or Nnamdi Madubuike up front due to injuries, while Jaire Alexander was a healthy scratch in the secondary. Still, this unit must prove it can have some success vs. elite offenses; otherwise, we might be talking about another \"What if?\" season for Lamar and Co. So, why only drop the 1-2 Ravens to No. 7? I doubt there are more than six teams against whom they'd be underdogs against on a neutral field. In Marcus Mariota's first start in three seasons, he performed ably, shaking off an early fumble to slice up the Raiders. The operation ran smoothly because the run game immediately produced, and Washington set a physical tone for the day. Five different runners carried the ball three times or more, all of them productive. The explosive plays also returned to the offense -- and special teams, with Jaylin Lane's 90-yard punt-return score. The Commanders scored more points on Sunday (41) than in the first two games combined (39), and they suddenly have to feel a lot better heading into this week's game at Atlanta if they need to go back to Mariota in what could be a fun revenge game for the backup QB. Jayden Daniels' long-term health is of primary importance, so Washington shouldn't mess around here if the face of the franchise remains compromised. Folks, this team is looking fantastic. I realize more than a few of us fell for New Orleans last season when they scored 91 points in two games -- only for the Saints to finish at 5-12 -- but this Indianapolis team looks different. That's now three straight impressive showings to open the season, with a pick-six less than a minute into the game and another highly efficient offensive performance. The Colts have committed zero turnovers through three games, and they've punted only once. Daniel Jones is third in the NFL in pass yards, leads qualified quarterbacks in yards per attempt and has accounted for six TDs. He should be in the early MVP discussion -- damn whatever biases we had coming in. Jonathan Taylor also belongs in that discussion, as the 26-year-old back is enjoying one of the best starts of his career. Indy is on the road again at the Rams this Sunday, and if the Colts pull that one off, you're just hating if you don't buy in heavily. The Rams defensively frustrated the Eagles in their first five full drives and appeared to be in complete control of the game, up 19 in the third quarter. But things took a drastic turn for the worse as the offense stalled, ultimately resulting in a punt and two blocked field goals to close out the game. On defense, they came unglued as the pressure up front couldn't compensate for the porous coverage on the back end. For more than half the game, Los Angeles made its case to be considered among the NFL's elite teams. Then, with one precipitous fall -- even in the lion's den against a team that has won 19 of 20 games -- those thoughts came crashing down. This remains a dangerous L.A. team, but one that must immediately face another contender, with the 3-0 Colts rolling into town fresh off another statement victory. You only get so many true measuring-stick games in a season. Signing Tyquan Thornton looks like a pretty genius move now. Making a little over a million bucks, Thornton all but bailed the Chiefs out Sunday night in a second-half flourish and a comfortable -- albeit unattractive -- road victory over the Giants. The offense had its typical struggles early, and it could have been worse, had Patrick Mahomes not taken the ball back from Bobby Okereke after giving it up on an ill-fated backward pass. Starting a drive at the Giants' 47-yard line and missing a 40-yard field goal felt like a turnover, with the Chiefs holding a delicate 6-0 lead at the time. Thankfully, New York provided little explosion and couldn't turn the game. Kansas City's defense, which has been good two games in a row, largely stonewalled Big Blue. Then Mahomes and Thornton connected for a breathing-room TD and two big downfield catches to set up the put-it-away score. It might not have been the tune-up performance the Chiefs wanted prior to hosting the Ravens this Sunday, but it was an important win nonetheless. Mac Jones looked doomed when he threw a fourth-quarter interception, and the 49ersâ chances of beating the Cardinals dropped to 16 percent, per Next Gen Stats, after the disastrous safety with just over three minutes left. But the San Francisco defense held, and Jones rallied the team down the field to set up the game-winning kick for a huge divisional win and a 3-0 start. Ricky Pearsall was quiet in the first 20 minutes but ultimately came up with big catch after big catch, including a massive deep grab on fourth-and-2 in the final quarter. After the victory, however, awful news arrived with Nick Bosaâs torn ACL. The Ninersâ defense has done its job so far, but that job is about to be a lot more difficult, especially with some tougher games upcoming. Itâs rarely easy in San Francisco, as Bosa is just the latest big-name 49er to go down with a major injury the past few years. The Seahawks had to feel good about Sundayâs blowout, which was all but in the bag early in the second quarter. The Saints were no feared opponent, but they came in with two close losses and left with a whooping. Seattle was able to pull starters early in the fourth quarter and turn its attention to the next three games: at Arizona, home against the Bucs, then at Jacksonville. Sam Darnold has settled in a bit now, stringing two strong performances back to back. The Seahawks didnât need to drive long fields, and they took care of business with four TDs in five red-zone trips. Defensively, they brought a lot of heat on Spencer Rattler, and the secondary held up well, forcing the Saints to throw short and preventing long pass plays. And, yes, the special teams were once again great. These next few games should give us a better idea of whether the 'Hawks can keep this formula going, but it has been more encouraging than not so far. The Broncos are now 2-8 in one-score games since the start of the 2024 campaign, and they have self-inflicted wounds to blame for Sunday's 23-20 defeat to the Chargers. Ten penalties were killers -- first on defense, then late in the game on offense. Denver went 2-for-13 on third downs, including two big misses in the final two drives. Bo Nix's scramble was inches away from converting a third-and-13 with six minutes left in the game, and Nix barely overthrew a streaking Courtland Sutton with less than two minutes remaining. That's when Denver's defense came up short, allowing the game-tying and game-winning drives in the final five minutes. The offensive issues must be addressed, but this is a defense that came into the season thinking it could be a top-five unit in the NFL, perhaps even the league's best group. Through three games, that hasn't been the case. The Broncos are by no means out of anything at 1-2, with two nail-biter losses, but they're also not yet ready to win these types of games, which is concerning. Even if the Bengals were their own worst enemies on Sunday, the Vikings showed enough with Carson Wentz at the helm to have reasonable hope they can hold the fort until J.J. McCarthyâs return. Wentz was sharp early, cooled off and then heated back up in a net-positive performance. Even while taking three sacks, Wentz kept the chains moving by finding open guys. Minnesotaâs run game (even without Aaron Jones) and the defense did a lot of the heavy lifting, with two defensive touchdowns and five turnovers giving the offense all the opportunities they needed and then some. Thirteen penalties, most of them on offense, were a bummer, and they will give Kevin OâConnell his white-board point for the week ahead of the big Euro duo against the Steelers and Browns prior to the early bye. If the Vikings can make it back home with a winning record, theyâll be in far better shape to handle the most lethal part of the schedule after the bye. Sunday showed it was too soon to punt on Minnesota. The Steelers started hot and finished strong, but the in-between was shockingly bad for stretches offensively. Even Pittsburgh's defense, which came up with several big plays, had room for improvement, allowing New England to stay in the game until the final minutes despite ending up plus-four in the turnover margin. There were too many negative plays offensively (nine, not counting kneeldowns) and very few explosive gains. Defensively, critical penalties and steady gains from the Pats nearly undid the Steelers, but two massive red-zone takeaways bailed them out. The situational football was mostly good Sunday, but the Steelers have to come away from this game knowing they were fortunate not to blow all the extra possessions they gained. This was a much-needed win, but there's still plenty to tidy up before Ireland. The Panthers, Bengals and Texans might not represent the most fearsome trio of opponents, but the Jaguarsâ defense held up well against all three, for the most part, which is a big reason for the teamâs 2-1 start. Theyâll rue letting that Cincinnati game get away, but Sunday was a turn in the right direction. A young team has to make big plays in crunch time to learn how to win, and the Jaguars did just that by causing three fourth-quarter turnovers vs. Houston -- their third straight three-takeaway game to open the season. Liam Coenâs offense still has plenty of room for growth, and Brian Thomas Jr.âs struggles have been borderline alarming. He had three drops by my count and seemed mostly miserable for the gameâs first 58 minutes, but Thomas came up with a massive catch late to help Jacksonville pull out the thriller and earn a big divisional win. The Cardinals have been playing with fire to start the season, but they didnât get burned until Sunday. Following two close victories, Arizona appeared poised to make it three straight after the ageless Calais Campbell forced a safety with 3:15 remaining, giving the Cardinals the ball and a 15-13 lead. If Zay Jones would have made a catch on third-and-9, they win. Instead, he didnât, and the defense couldnât stop the 49ers late. This is a bad loss, no two ways about it. Jones wasnât the only goat, as both Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emari Demercado had awful drops on a second-half drive that bogged down and ended in a field goal. Harrison came up with a big catch on the game-tying drive in the fourth quarter, but he had just three receptions for 44 yards, continuing his slow start to the season. Adding injury to insult, James Conner will undergo season-ending surgery, casting more doubt on an offense that has underperformed so far. This was the Ben Johnson offense Bears fans signed up to see. Immediately, they attacked Dallasâ most glaring weaknesses -- defending shot plays up the seams -- and didnât slow down until late. It was a far cleaner and more consistent offensive effort against the Cowboys than weâd seen in the first two games. While there were glimpses of hope in Weeks 1 and 2, Week 3 provided the vision, even if the Cowboys clearly have their issues on defense. The Bears managed their secondary issues fairly well and came up with enough big plays on that side of the ball to feel good about things. Theyâll have a chance to keep both elements going this week against a battered Raiders team, with the bye shockingly upon them in Week 5. Jake Browning might have had some moments while leading the 2023 Bengals back to respectability, but he also has now thrown a league-high five interceptions on just 59 attempts. His first pick was run back for a score on Sunday, putting Cincy in a 14-0 hole only nine minutes in. It was 41-3, Vikings, when Browning threw his second one. It wasnât a great game for the Bengalsâ defense, but it was a truly putrid one for the offense, which turned the ball over five times, leading to 31 Minnesota points. The Bengals also had two more fumbles, but they recovered them. This was already the biggest blowout in franchise history, but it very easily could have been even worse. Cincinnati is still 2-1, but Sunday poked even more holes in its porous rÃ©sumÃ©. Can Browning find a way to get back in rhythm? Three of the Panthersâ seven victories with Bryce Young starting at quarterback have come against Atlanta. Heâs 3-1 against the Falcons and 4-25 against the rest of the league, which is strange, but no one is going to sneeze at a 30-zip whooping after the uninspired 0-2 start. In the first 96 minutes of the season, the Panthers were outscored 53-13. Since then, it has been a 49-0 edge for Carolina. They certainly feel like a more confident operation right now, especially defensively. There are still some warts that could come out against stronger teams, but this suddenly doesnât look close to the worst defense in the league. Chau Smith-Wade had a pick-six, Mike Jackson added a pick and Christian Rozeboom and AâShawn Robinson were highly disruptive. This might not be the 1985 Bears, but the Panthersâ no-name defense has come alive. I donât think many saw Michael Penix Jr.âs nightmare game coming Sunday against a Panthers defense that a year ago allowed the most points in NFL history. Even if we agree Carolinaâs defense has come a long way since, Penix was all out of sorts. He started the game 3-of-5 passing for 37 yards in the first three minutes; after that point, Penix went 15-for-31 for 135 yards and two picks, one which was run back for a TD early in the third quarter. It was a 10-0 game prior to that pick-six, and Atlanta was still nominally in it, down 20-0, when he threw his second INT. The Falcons handed off just 10 times in the first half and never got back to the run game until it was a laugher. The defense canât really be blamed when the Panthers started three drives inside Atlantaâs 45-yard line, producing 13 points right there. It was a demoralizing game for a team that had looked highly competitive in the first two games but now has only one TD in its past 23 possessions. It felt like Houston gambled that former offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik and former O-line coach Chris Strausser were holding this attack back, as the Texans seemed to believe a few coaching changes would fix everything. Right now, the results haven't borne that out at all, with the Texans falling to 0-3. Their meager 271 yards in Sunday's 17-10 loss to the Jaguars actually represented a high-water mark for the season, with Houston committing three fourth-quarter turnovers, including two in the final four minutes inside the Jacksonville 30-yard line. Houston ran the ball a bit better, and Nico Collins had a big game, but his late fumble was wicked. The Texans have made four trips to the red zone this season and have six points to show for them. C.J. Stroud hasn't done enough, but the blocking also remains a big issue. The protection was actually decent on the final drive in Jacksonville, but rookie bookend Aireontae Ersery allowed pressure and Stroud's arm was hit on the game-sealing pick. The Texans can get off the schneid by beating the winless Titans at home this Sunday, but then they have road games against the Ravens and Seahawks. This is a big hole theyâve dug for themselves. The pass defense has utterly crumbled the past two weeks. Russell Wilson and Caleb Williams have otherwise looked ordinary this season, but the Cowboys have brought out the absolute best in both, allowing Wilson to throw for 450 yards and three scores and Williams to tie his career high with four TD passes. Williams had 239 pass yards and three TDs at halftime, so it could have been worse had the game been closer. The problem with Dallasâ defense is, well, just about everything. No pressure, poor tackling, awful coverage lapses -- give them credit for not making this about only one thing. Itâs all bad, and itâs hard to envision Dak Prescott and the offense being able to bail out this unit on a weekly basis. Some games, sure, but with CeeDee Lamb and Tyler Booker likely to miss multiple weeks, the task will be that much harder. ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿Shelby Harrisï»¿ï»¿ï»¿' late block not only dramatically changed the arc of Sunday's incredible win, but it also put him in rare air. That was Harris' sixth-career blocked FG try in his 12th season, making him one of the elite niche players in the NFL. But the Browns also have a young foundation that appears too good to overlook suddenly. We'll see if they got the QB pick(s) right, but so far, ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿Mason Grahamï»¿ï»¿ï»¿, ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿Carson Schwesingerï»¿ï»¿ï»¿, ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿Quinshon Judkinsï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ and ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿Harold Fannin Jr.ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ have been fabulous rookie additions from GM Andrew Berry, with each of them having their fingerprints on Cleveland's dramatic victory -- the first of the season. ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿Joe Flaccoï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ still looks old at times, and the offensive limitations can't be ignored, but this win seemed to alter the outlook for this team. The Raiders made some fun and interesting additions this offseason, especially on the offensive side of the ball, but nothing is really working as it should right now. The blocking up front hasnât been the sole reason for the unitâs struggles, but itâs at the top of the list of concerns right now. Geno Smith might not make it through the season if he keeps taking hits and sacks at this rate. And itâs hard to get the ball to your first-round running back if there are no holes through which Ashton Jeanty can run. Thatâs not to suggest Jeanty hasnât been disappointing on his own, which I would say he has. But given the limitations, including Brock Bowers playing hurt, itâs hard to put much blame on the rookie. Combine that with allowing 41 points to a backup-QB-led team, and the vibes seem pretty dour. You could make a case they could be a really ugly 3-0, but the Patriots were also one or two plays away from being 0-3 right now. Instead, theyâre 1-2 with two home losses, and Sundayâs turnover party showed a shocking lack of discipline from a Mike Vrabel-coached team. Theyâre up to 27 penalties on the season, which also doesnât reflect too kindly on the new coach. Rhamondre Stevensonâs two lost fumbles further an issue that could soon come to a head as far as the backfield rotation goes. And Drake Maye, for all his fine plays in Sundayâs game and so far this season, is making too many avoidable mistakes. In addition to his fumble and pick, Maye also had two bad passes that should have been intercepted. If the Patriots struggle at home this week against an energized Panthers team, it might be time to permanently adjust our expectations for this season. Aaron Glenn doesn't have a win as head coach yet, and he might get sick of moral victories after notching his second in three weeks. As they did during their Week 1 loss to Pittsburgh, the Jets hung tough and took a late lead, only to see it evaporate. Sunday's comeback push against the Bucs was exceptionally improbable, considering the score, the location and the quality of the opponent, but Glenn's team came up a few plays short. There were plenty of positives, but also enough negatives not to celebrate much. Tyrod Taylor threw for two TDs and used his legs well, but he was sacked four times and under heavy fire, including on a brutal pick-six before the half. Taylor helped the Jets dig themselves out of a huge deficit, but they were playing out of character -- and out of desperation. If they want to be a run-heavy, defense-driven team, there's still a whole lot of work left to do. With a pick-six less than a minute into the game, two missed field-goal tries and some painful penalties, the Titans put themselves in a deep hole they couldnât get out of against the Colts. Thatâs now two home losses where theyâve been outclassed by better-caliber teams, giving them a clear measuring stick to aim for -- one they canât quite yet reach. The most concerning element was the lack of energy early, and Colts WR Michael Pittman Jr. said he could sense it in pregame warmups. Brian Callahan has a lot of work to do to keep this team competitive. The Titans can build around Cam Ward and a few of their encouraging offensive pieces, but theyâve been borderline anemic offensively for stretches and not much better defensively. With three straight (and four of the next five) on the road, Tennessee has to turn the tide quickly or risk another long, losing season. Watching Russell Wilson throw the ball away on three of his four plays in the red zone late in the fourth quarter had to be a low point for Giants fans in Week 3. Two Wilson interceptions and three turnovers on downs killed any chance of an upset, even if it was a close game at one point. Will ï»¿Bobby Okerekeï»¿ live down having ï»¿Patrick Mahomesï»¿ strip the ball from him? It was a 6-6 game when that happened, and New York needed one of those plays to pull off the shocker. Cam Skattebo had his best game yet, but the Giants couldnât get the ball to Malik Nabers. Another disappointing offensive performance and their 28th loss in their past 37 games. But there's at least some intrigue now. Jaxson Dart barely played Monday, but he'll be the starter in Week 4 against the Chargers. Let's see if Brian Daboll made the right call here. The Dolphins had a chance to beat the Bills last week. They made a few crucial mistakes on offense (the late INT), defense (penalties, poor tackling) and special teams (Zach Sielerâs critical penalty), and that was that. The 0-3 Dolphins have decades of history flying in their face as far as salvaging the season is concerned, but the improved effort and offensive execution is at least a starting point. Iâd personally love to see more of Ollie Gordon II, and also more second- and third-level shots, please. Tua Tagovailoa was throwing short most of the night, and the Bills were squatting on everything. We know the Fins have explosive weapons; now they just need to be featured more readily. If the defense canât make major improvements fast, Miami is likely going to be in a few shootouts. As of halftime Sunday, New Orleans had outgained Seattle while racking up 15 first downs and running more than twice as many plays as the Seahawks. Yet, even with zero turnovers from either team, the Saints found themselves down 38-6. Eight first-half penalties, a turnover on downs and some truly awful special-teams play were the major reasons for the absurd hole they put themselves in. New Orleans missed a field-goal try, had one punt blocked deep in its own territory and had another one run back 95 yards for a score -- all in the first 30 minutes. That's a pretty good formula for being blown out of a game early. The offense and defense didn't do enough to overcome those major deficits, and the Saints fell to 0-3, with the well-rested Bills in Buffalo up next. Even with some winnable games thereafter, there have been few reasons for hope amid the brutal start.

    "bodyText": "Harry Douglas breaks down what Jaxson Dart needs to do to impress on his first NFL start vs. the Chargers. (1:30) For better or worse, the New York Giants will get a good sense of their prospects for turning their winless season around with rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart taking the reins at home against the undefeated Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday. At least one fan believes Dart's highly anticipated debut will go favorably. \"I have all the confidence in the world that he'll do really well,\" said Eric Kjar, Dart's former coach at Corner Canyon High School in Draper, Utah. \"The No. 1 reason is that he'll definitely be prepared. He puts a ton of time into his personal preparation -- more than I've ever seen. He's also the ultimate competitor, and he's got a contagious energy. He's always elevated the people around him.\" Kjar's perspective is logical: He watched Dart lead the country in passing yards (4,691) and touchdowns (67) and rush for 1,195 yards en route to taking the Corner Canyon Chargers to a 14-0 record and a state title in 2020. Dart, who finished ranked No. 19 in the SportsCenter NEXT 100 in 2021, was subsequently named Gatorade Player of the Year. A post shared by SportsCenter NEXT (@sportscenternext) Those numbers and accolades came with a lot of memorable moments. Here are five from the 2020 season that stuck out to Kjar. Dart set the tone for what was to come in just the second game of his final high school season. The 6-foot-2 signal-caller reeled off five touchdowns in the first quarter -- four passing and one rushing -- to lead the Chargers to a 56-0 win over Herriman High School. He finished with 480 passing yards and six total touchdowns. In Kjar's words: \"That's the game that I knew that he was super special. He just lit them up. He just throws it so good, and he's accurate, but the best thing about him is that he's so competitive. It's a different breed. Watching him in that game was just like, 'Wow!'\" Dart wasn't a household name before his TV debut against Bingham High School, but viewers across the country and college coaches began to take notice after he tactically dismantled the Miners in every way. Dart went 16-of-23 for 279 yards and six touchdowns while adding 132 rushing yards in the 42-20 win. In Kjar's words: \"That was definitely his coming-out party to the country. He really seized the moment there. That's when colleges really took to him, and he got a ton of attention after that game. That's when things got pretty crazy for him.\" • 76ers' Jared McCain addresses viral bench press in classic jersey reveal\n• Packers-Cowboys through the years\n• Alabama-Georgia: On-field trends from their last Athens meeting\n• Jets HC Aaron Glenn is embracing his viral moment\n• Loyola's Sister Jean announces retirement due to health concerns\n• Jaylen Brown speaks at Bill Nye's Hollywood star dedication Late in the fourth quarter, Dart and the Chargers were on the Lone Peak 20-yard line facing a 4th-and-2 when he barreled over Knights defensive star John Henry Daley to keep the drive alive and set up a score that put the game away. The Chargers went on to win 35-25. In Kjar's words: \"Jaxson just had that thing about him that allowed him to step up and be better than everybody else in the most intense situations. It's just a gear that he has that sets him apart. I mean, he just went right through the kid, who was a great player and having a great game in his own right.\" Multiple turnovers and miscues were plaguing the undefeated Chargers all night as they found themselves trailing by 14 points headed into the fourth quarter at Skyridge High. But with the game on the line, Dart refused to let his team fall, leading back-to-back scoring drives and converting a 2-point conversion to reclaim the lead and finish off the Falcons 29-26. In Kjar's words: \"He was so dominant and really took the game over in a really adverse scenario. He was just so fired up, and he's so competitive, and he was refusing to let us lose that game. He ran over a couple linebackers and really got the guys going. We were not looking good, but then he just turned it on. Just like that!\" The Chargers were riding a 13-game winning streak entering the highly anticipated rematch with state powerhouse Lone Peak, and Dart made sure they had no letdowns in the finale. He picked Lone Peak apart with a precise aerial attack (24-of-39 for 328 yards and four touchdowns) while keeping the defense off-balance with his legs (118 rushing yards and a touchdown). By halftime, Dart and the Chargers had put the game away with a 45-0 lead. In Kjar's words: \"He was so efficient and so productive in that game. He was just on fire. I don't think he missed a beat at all. It was just the way he played, and the way everyone played around him as a result. There was just no answer for the zone that he was in. It was a show.\""

    "bodyText": "BEREA, Ohio -- Sunday's matchup between the Cleveland Browns and Detroit Lions pits one of the NFL's stingiest defenses against one of the league's most explosive offenses. But Browns star pass rusher Myles Garrett is downplaying comments by Lions offensive coordinator John Morton, who said Cleveland hadn't faced a challenge like what Detroit will offer. \"He's entitled to his opinion. He hasn't seen a defensive front like ours,\" Garrett said Friday. \"He's entitled to say what he wants, and we have the privilege to see who's right. I think it'll be a battle of ideologies, and I think our [defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz] also has some things to say. We have to be the ones to put it into action. We'll have to meet and see who's right.\" Garrett was responding after Morton said Thursday that his Lions will pose a much tougher test to the Browns' top-ranked run defense than the previous three opponents. \"Our front, right now, we're moving guys,\" Morton said. \"I don't think they've seen a run game like ours yet. We have patience. We stick with it. I think that's the biggest thing. Let's keep doing what we've been doing. We got to do that so we can stay manageable on third down and two-to-six, we've got to be in that area. So first and second down is going to be crucial.\" Both teams have reasons to be confident. The Browns have allowed just 172 rushing yards through three games, limiting top rushers such as the Baltimore Ravens' Derrick Henry and the Green Bay Packers' Josh Jacobs. The Lions rank fourth in rushing yards per game (149.0) and are coming off a statement road victory over the Ravens in which they ran for 224 yards. Multiple Browns defenders and Schwartz emphasized stopping the run as a priority this week. \"They want to run the ball as much as possible, and we love stopping the run,\" Garrett said. \"Our DC is very much stuck in his ways and wanting to be stubborn in, 'This is how we're going to do things. We're going to man up on the outside, and we're going to get after guys with four.' \"They want to get the ball out quickly, want to get it to their skill guys, want to get to the perimeter. And after that, they want to go downhill on you. I think those two ideologies will come to a head this Sunday.\" ESPN's Eric Woodyard contributed to this report."

    "bodyText": "Dan Orlovsky breaks down what's at stake for Jaxson Dart and Brian Daboll at the New York Giants. (1:20) EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- It was as if there were two different versions of the New York Giants' offense this summer and at training camp. One that Russell Wilson and the first-team offense ran and the other that rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart operated with the second team. In reality, the plays weren't all that different, in fact, mostly the same. Yet, the on-field product looked vastly different when Dart was behind center. Dart, the 25th pick in this year's draft, has better physical skills than the 36-year-old Wilson is at this point of his career. Nobody is going to argue against that. He also brings a youthful exuberance that was part of why he won over coach Brian Daboll during the predraft process. The Giants are hoping all this is evident on the field Sunday when Dart makes his first career start against the Los Angeles Chargers at MetLife Stadium (1 p.m. EST, CBS). \"Obviously, it's going to be some new stuff. Just more of what he did in college. Obviously, just going to be some new faces for the NFL to see,\" wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson said. \"And defenses haven't seen exactly our offense and the things we can do. It will be exciting to see what we do out there on Sunday.\" New York (0-3) has already put on tape some zone-read and run-pass-option (RPO) with Dart this regular season. He has been on the field for six snaps through three weeks -- all runs. Five of the plays were designed runs; the other was an intended pass where he scrambled. The Giants gained 38 total yards on those six plays, an average of 6.3 yards per play. They've ran three zone-reads through three games with Wilson for five yards, an average of 1.7 yards per play. This is just one of the ways the Giants' offense should look different come Sunday. The zone-read and the RPOs are almost certainly going to become a bigger part of the offense. It's a portion of what Dart did well last year at Ole Miss, when he completed 83% of his passes on RPOs. He also ran for 495 yards and three touchdowns. \"There will be certain elements of what Jaxson has done well, whether it was in college or high school,\" Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka said. \"You want to fit that system to the player, any player, to what their strengths are. I think Jaxson is going to do a nice job and we'll put together a plan that he can work with.\" The Giants' coaches have been in contact with members of Ole Miss' staff dating back to the predraft process about what worked best for Dart. They wanted to collect schemes and plays that could be implemented into their offense for the young quarterback. It all makes sense. Find what works and make Dart as comfortable as possible. There also is an expectation for there to be more of a high-tempo offense. Daboll and the Giants used that in the preseason for Dart, with significant success. Tempo is also a staple of the Ole Miss offense that Dart ran. \"Our system really has a lot of NFL elements in it offensively for them -- protections, routes, different runs and stuff. We just happen to go really fast,\" Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin said this week on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\"  \"I think over time, defensive coordinators have said, including [former Alabama coach Nick Saban], that what Ole Miss and this system does is it gives you problem plays but goes really fast also. I think that has helped our quarterbacks play really well. It's awesome for Jaxson.\" Playing with tempo and without a huddle a good chunk of the time is what the Washington Commanders have also done for their young quarterback Jayden Daniels. That led to an NFC Championship Game appearance in his rookie year. It seems likely the Giants will do the same. They used no-huddle on only eight of Wilson's 127 dropbacks in the first three games. What exactly it will look like when Dart is the full-time starting quarterback (Daboll officially named him the starter on Wednesday for the rest of the season) still remains to be seen. But it will likely include some portion of these philosophies. Daboll likes the element of the unknown. \"We'll see,\" he said of how different the offense will look. \"It's a young rookie quarterback. We'll see.\" Naturally it will be different. The summer and preseason showed that. Dart isn't Wilson and Wilson isn't Dart. They have varying skill sets, strengths and differences. Wilson doesn't have Dart's ability to run and Dart doesn't have Wilson's experience reading defenses. \"I wouldn't necessarily say it's going to look a lot different, but definitely going to look different. Two different quarterbacks,\" Robinson said. \"At the end of the day, it's still our offense. Feel confident in who is back there running it.\""

    "bodyText": "CBS LAS VEGAS -- — Maybe this was the Caleb Williams many expected when he was drafted first overall last year. Or perhaps Dallas' defense is just that bad. The Bears' game at Las Vegas on Sunday might be a clue as to whether Williams' four-touchdown performance in a blowout victory over the Cowboys last weekend was a sign of what's to come or if it was simply a high mark in an otherwise inconsistent early career. “I can’t say enough, really, about (Williams') approach,” Chicago coach Ben Johnson said. “When you have the approach that’s right, we’re going to continue to see him get better. Kudos to him. He won offensive player of the week there for the NFC and he came in (Wednesday) completely unfazed by it. I tried to recognize him in front of the group and he wasn’t having it.” The Raiders are going with the approach that the Williams who tore apart the Cowboys is the one they should be prepared to face. “He’s a very, very special athlete, and he’s got great sense, great awareness about throwing the football and running the football,” Raiders coach Pete Carroll said. “He’ll be a prolific scrambler by the time we check out his years. He’s really good at it and throws really well on the run, too.” Carroll said Johnson's influence as the first-year coach is already coming through in Williams' play. Few dispute Williams' big arm and elite athleticism, but he often holds the ball too long and takes unnecessary hits and sacks in search of a big play. The pressure is on Williams in his second season to show why he was worth the top pick. Beating the Cowboys soundly was a positive step in that direction. A similar performance against the Raiders would be another one. “We have a tall task at hand,” Williams said. “Every week is important. Every game. Every moment. That was a good moment we had Sunday, and it’s time to move on to the Raiders.” Tucker's breakout game Raiders wide receiver Tre Tucker is known for using his speed to stretch the field, but the third-year pro worked on his overall game this summer. It showed in Sunday's 41-24 loss at Washington, where he set career highs with eight receptions for 145 yards and three touchdowns. “Tre is a true professional as far as how he goes about his work,” fellow receiver Jakobi Meyers said. “He attacks it. He has a plan. He writes down every detail. If he messes up, he goes back and watches it and fixes it, and I think the off-the-field stuff translates onto the field.” Bears defense bounces back Chicago went from blowing an 11-point lead in the season opener against Minnesota to nearly matching a franchise record for points allowed in a 52-21 blowout at Detroit. But against Dallas, it was a different story. The Bears got four takeaways, including a spectacular forced fumble by Tyrique Stevenson. They also had three interceptions — two by linebacker Tremaine Edmunds — and held Dak Prescott to 251 yards passing while sacking him twice and picking him off two times. “The work we put in as a collective, it matters, and it’s going to show up because we work hard and we trust each other,” Stevenson said. “It’s allowing us to believe in each other and trust each other and know that we’re going to be out there having each other’s back and play free.” Run-down Bears Bears running back D’Andre Swift is averaging 3.5 yards per carry and rookie Kyle Monangai is at 3.4 per attempt. Johnson said the team is “very conscious” of the problems in the run game. “I’ve alluded to it in the past that it can take a little bit of time before this all meshes and all gels together,” he said. “We’ve got some new faces up front that haven’t played a ton of ball together yet. That’s part of the process. It’s also for the runners to understand what we intend to do with some of these play calls, where we want that ball to hit. And then at the end of the day, they take their natural skill set and they make something big out of it.” Raiders not so special teams Special teams are usually a major strength for the Raiders, but against the Commanders, they gave up a 69-yard kickoff return to set up a touchdown and a 90-yard punt return for a TD. Carroll credited Commanders coach Dan Quinn and special teams coordinator Larry Izzo — who worked for Carroll in Seattle — but acknowledged the Raiders had some things to clean up. “I have to do a better job of getting these guys ready to go in the matchups that we have regardless, and it showed up on special teams quite, quite clearly,” Carroll said. \"Fundamentals just being low and leverage and attack and defending blocks and beating the blockers on our coverage. All of that. It was too many big plays that led to an easy win for them.” ------ AP Sports Writer Andrew Seligman in Chicago contributed to this report. ------ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Las Vegas, NV 79° 2h 5h 6h"

    "bodyText": "Stephen A. Smith says in order for Brian Daboll's job to be saved, Jaxson Dart must give an \"indication that he's being developed.\" (1:03) EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- New York Giants coach Brian Daboll didn't provide much insight into why he benched quarterback Russell Wilson for rookie Jaxson Dart, aside from saying it was his decision. The Giants informed Wilson and Dart of the decision Tuesday. Dart will start Sunday against the Los Angeles Chargers and Wilson will be the backup. \"The conversations that I've had with these young men will be private,\" Daboll said Wednesday. \"The details will be private. All I can tell you is we're going with Jaxson and we're getting ready to play, so I'm not going to add too much to it. Those are private conversations. \"It's my decision and we're going with Jaxson.\" Daboll said that the change is for the rest of the season and that Wilson will serve as Dart's backup. He said Wilson was a \"pro\" about losing his starting position. The veteran Wilson intends to remain with the Giants as the backup. He insisted Wednesday he's not done but doesn't intend to ask for his release or a trade. \"No, I'm focused on helping this team win,\" Wilson said. \"I'm focused on helping Jaxson. I'm focused on me getting ready to be the best version of me today on Wednesday. I want to be here. I love this organization. I love the process of it all, I love the guys in the locker room. I'm not giving up on us in this season.\" Speaking to Giants players, they believe the offense will look different with Dart behind center. They note the energy and youthful exuberance that he will add. Dart, the 25th overall pick in this year's draft, isn't looking at himself as the savior. He's not thinking about the idea that his success or failure will determine Daboll's job security. \"I think the biggest thing for me is I want to do my best to be a spark,\" Dart said. \"I want to create excitement on the field. I want to be explosive when opportunities are there. Try to just bring a little bit of swagger.\" Giants players didn't object to the change. They've liked what they've seen from Dart. It also didn't seem as if they were against Wilson remaining as the starter. \"The decision is not up to me, it's up to [Daboll],\" said star wide receiver Malik Nabers, who did not practice because of a shoulder injury. \"They thought that was the best decision for the team and I'm just following on.\" It was reported before the draft that Dart was Daboll's quarterback of choice when the Giants were selecting in the first round. The Ole Miss product won the Giants coach over with the way he handled the predraft process. Dart was made the backup ahead of veteran Jameis Winston before Week 1, a move that a source said was pushed for by Daboll. The coach is now the driving force behind going with the rookie after just three weeks. \"Yeah, it's my decision. Again, we have conversations, we've said this numerous times, I have plenty of conversations. That's the direction that I wanted to go, and that's the direction that we're going to go,\" Daboll said. \"There's good conversation we had. Those are private conversations, like I said before, but ultimately it comes down to me and the decision that I made.\" The switch puts the spotlight even further on Daboll coming off a 3-14 campaign last year. Owner John Mara said after the season that there would have to be better results if this regime is going to make it to a fifth year. The Giants (0-3) are seeking their first win of the season Sunday at home against the undefeated Chargers. New York is looking at Dart to spark an offense that failed to produce 300 total yards in two of three games. The Giants lost 22-9 on Sunday night against the Kansas City Chiefs. \"We've had three games, haven't put it together all collectively and made the decision to play Jaxson,\" Daboll said. The concentration now turns to preparation for the Chargers. Dart was first up at practice among the quarterbacks. Daboll stood directly behind him for almost the entire workout that was open to the media. Usually, he moves around checking on different areas of the team. But Daboll and the Giants are clearly heavily invested in Dart's success. All eyeballs are on the 25th pick in this year's draft. \"I expect him to prepare. We expect him to go out here and get better each time he plays,\" Daboll said. \"It's not always going to be perfect, but I do think that he has the right makeup and athleticism, and look, we're going to do everything we can do to help him be the best player. I know he is as well. It's not just on one person, it's on the entire team, and that's what we're going to do.\" The Chargers are hardly a soft landing. They have a top-10 defense through three weeks this season. Dart had a strong summer and preseason, but this will be a level he has never faced. \"I don't think any rookie quarterback is ever just ready to play,\" Daboll said. \"You put him in there because you think that he's done enough to show you that he can go out there and compete, and he's done that every step of the way. \"And that's why I made the decision.\""

    "bodyText": "Dan Graziano gives props to Dan Campbell and says the Lions are right where they left off last season. (0:55) DETROIT -- Two weeks after putting the final touches on the Detroit Lions' 2025 NFL draft, Brad Holmes returned to his old stomping grounds. Draped in full black academic regalia, the 46-year-old Lions executive vice president and general manager was addressing the graduates at his alma mater, North Carolina A&T, as the HBCU's commencement speaker. He didn't want to miss the opportunity to inspire change. Speaking from behind a glass lectern at the First Horizon Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina, Holmes delivered a powerful message to the 1,600-plus graduates. \"Choose your hard,\" Holmes emphasized on the stage. \"However, you slice it, whichever path you choose, it's going to be hard. And I tell our scouts that 'til this day: It's hard to be detailed and go the extra mile, dot every I, cross every T. It's also hard not to go the extra mile and be detailed and thorough. \"That shortcut may feel good in the short term, but life's gonna catch [up] with you.\" Holmes knows all about taking the hard road. When he was hired as GM of the Lions in 2021, the franchise was coming off a 5-11 season, it hadn't been to the playoffs since 2016 and hadn't won a postseason game since 1991. Since 2021, Holmes and coach Dan Campbell have led one of the more remarkable turnarounds in recent memory, leading the once laughingstock Lions to consecutive playoff appearances in 2023 and 2024, which included an NFC Championship Game appearance in 2023 and a franchise-record 15 wins last season -- nearly all fueled by players Holmes drafted, signed or acquired. But a winner in Detroit isn't the only thing Holmes is focused on inspiring. He is one of six Black GMs in the NFL -- along with Kwesi Adofo-Mensah (Minnesota Vikings), Ryan Poles (Chicago Bears), Andrew Berry (Cleveland Browns), Chris Grier (Miami Dolphins) and Terry Fontenot (Atlanta Falcons) -- and one of a handful in the league's history. Recognizing the rarity of the opportunity he has in Detroit, Holmes is conscientious about trying to change the makeup of NFL front offices. When he was hired in Detroit, he brought in Ray Agnew and Mike Martin to assume prominent roles on his staff. And in 2024, he helped create the Wally Triplett Fellowship to help minority college students get introduced to careers in football outside of playing and coaching. Holmes does this all while standing on the shoulders of the men who came before him such as former Baltimore Ravens GM Ozzie Newsome and former New York Giants GM Jerry Reese, who have lent their support at different mileposts along his long road to Detroit -- a city whose history gives his position extra significance. He also understands the way to impact the lasting change he hopes to see -- like Newsome and Reese -- by continuing to win on the field and achieving his goal of bringing Detroit its first Super Bowl title. \"It's a responsibility that I don't take lightly,\" Holmes told ESPN at the NFL's annual meetings in April. \"I love that it's here in Detroit, that's a very diverse city. It's a Black city. I love that we can be deeply rooted in our culture, so I wouldn't want it in any other place.\" ON JAN. 14, 2021, the Lions organization reached a unanimous decision. After interviewing at least a dozen internal and external candidates for the vacant general manager position, Detroit's four-person group of Rod Wood (CEO/president), Chris Spielman (special assistant to the CEO/president), Mike Disner (chief operating officer) and team owner Sheila Ford Hamp decided Holmes was their guy. At 41 years old, Holmes became the second Black GM in team history, following Martin Mayhew, who held the post from 2009 to 2015. • Is the Seahawks' new offense working?\n• Which 0-3 team needs a win most?\n• Cards' Kyler Murray making key adjustments\n• What will Parsons' return to Dallas be like?\n• Winless Saints lean on Davis, Jordan's leadership \"When we were interviewing and hiring Brad, I wasn't thinking of him as being African American or anything else. I was just thinking of who's the best person for the job,\" Wood told ESPN. \"And if teams go into any of their hiring decisions looking for the best person and quit focusing on other things, there will be great opportunities for more people of color to be coaches and to be general managers.\" Although the NFL adopted the Rooney Rule in 2003 to increase opportunities for minority executives, general managers and head coaches, Wood wasn't fixated on that policy. With just eight wins over the previous two seasons, Wood said Detroit was looking for the \"best possible person.\" Holmes' football expertise -- particularly his scouting, drafting and development strategy -- coupled with his leadership and communication skills blew the hiring committee away, convincing it he was the one to lead the culture shift and full roster rebuild Detroit required. \"One thing that was unique about him, in terms of where we were as an organization, that I was aware of, and Brad wasn't, is that [former Lions quarterback] Matthew Stafford wanted to be traded,\" Wood said. \"I really wanted someone who had demonstrated excellent drafting.\" Holmes had spent 18 seasons in the Rams' front office, where he climbed into the executive ranks of the NFL from the bottom rung. He started as a public relations intern in 2003. He moved to the scouting department and eventually became the organization's director of college scouting, where he was pivotal in drafting quarterback Jared Goff, defensive tackle Aaron Donald and wide receiver Cooper Kupp -- players who built the foundation for the Rams' Super Bowl appearances in 2019 and 2022. Although Holmes was in his first season in Detroit when Los Angeles beat the Bengals in Super Bowl LVI, Rams GM Les Snead still credits Holmes for helping construct the roster. In Detroit, his gift for talent evaluation has continued. Six of the Lions Holmes has drafted have been selected to a Pro Bowl (wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, defensive end Aidan Hutchinson, offensive tackle Penei Sewell, running back Jahmyr Gibbs, safety Brian Branch and tight end Sam LaPorta) -- the most of any team in the NFL over that span, per ESPN Research. The team's success on the field has grown in proportion to the number of Holmes-selected players on the roster. The Lions went from a 3-13-1 record in his and Campbell's first year in charge to 9-8 in 2022 to 12-5 in 2023 to a record-setting 15-2 mark in 2024. On draft day, Holmes is known to buck tradition, according to ESPN draft analyst Jordan Reid. He has shown a willingness to select players based on their possible impact instead of prioritizing draft and consensus rankings. In the 2023 draft, he traded the sixth pick to the Arizona Cardinals for picks Nos. 12 and 18. With those selections, he stunned draft experts by selecting Gibbs, a running back out of Alabama, and off-ball Iowa linebacker Jack Campbell higher than either was projected. Holmes pointed out that each player filled a direct team need at the time. Since making the picks, he has been vindicated by the results: Gibbs quickly emerged as one of the league's best offensive threats, leading the NFL in touchdowns (20) while finishing third in all-purpose yards (1,929) last season. Campbell has been a rock in the middle of the defense. He finished eighth in Defensive Rookie of the Year voting in 2023 and has started in 32 of his 37 career games. \"One thing I love about [Holmes] is he doesn't care where he gets his guys, but he identifies where those guys are and he simply takes them,\" Reid said. \"And he identifies those guys that are Detroit Lions and embody everything about them. \"... He doesn't really care about what the consensus is about guys' draft positional value or whatever that may be. He identifies the guys that check the boxes of the characteristics that the Lions are looking for and if they're a culture fit, it doesn't matter if that's in the first round, the fourth round, the seventh round or whatever, he's gonna go out and get his guys.\" • Takeaways, questions from all games »\n• Graziano overreacts to Week 3 games »\n• Top plays » | Best, worst from fantasy »\n• Full Week 3 scoreboard » | More » Holmes has also been unafraid to make big trades and fill needs through free agency. Months into getting the Lions job, he traded Stafford -- the Lions' franchise leader in completions, attempts, passing yards and touchdowns -- to the Rams for Goff. Stafford helped Los Angeles win the Super Bowl in his first year there, but Goff -- who came to Detroit at a low point in his career -- has emerged as his heir apparent. Holmes has brought in other key players such as former Bears running back David Montgomery, signing him to a three-year, $18 million deal in March 2023. In Detroit, Montgomery has formed the league's most productive backfield with Gibbs. When one of his players breaks out, as part of his strategy to keep the cupboard stocked into the future, Holmes is quick to lock them down with long-term contract extensions. Over the past two seasons, Sewell, St. Brown and Goff have all signed new deals, with Hutchinson next in line. The full force of Holmes' vision was on display in the Lions' 38-30 victory at the Ravens on Monday night. Gibbs and Montgomery ran for two touchdowns each. St. Brown caught a TD and a critical fourth-down reception to salt the game away. And the defense, led by Hutchinson and Al-Quadin Muhammad -- a practice squad signing last October -- sacked Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson seven times, including 2.5 by Muhammad. \"It's really cool because I'm a Detroit Lions fan even though there's maybe gonna be moments during the course of a season where you're gonna have to pull against him or you're gonna play them and want to beat them,\" Snead said. \"Even having Jared Goff there to an extent is really cool to pull for them and the really unique [thing] is now being a Detroit Lions fan from afar, you actually expect them to win, and they win the majority of the time,\" he said. \"So, that's the thing you appreciate and hope that when someone is in your ecosystem.\" WHEN NEWS BROKE of Holmes' hire, congratulatory calls and text messages flooded his phone. Reese, the first Black GM to win a Super Bowl, was one of them. Although he didn't know Holmes personally, he wanted to lend his support. \"It's your turn to take us higher,\" Reese texted Holmes. Reese knew the significance of sharing the message. After becoming the third Black GM in NFL history with the Giants, legendary Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson surprised him with a call the day after the news was announced. \"I never talked to him, never had a conversation, you just knew he was a basketball coach for the Hoyas. He called me and said, 'Jerry, congratulations on getting the job.' I was saying stuff like, 'I'm gonna do my best,'\" Reese recalled. \"He was like, 'Nah, you can't fail.' So, I wore that like a badge of honor for him to call me because he did [not] know me to call but he reached out to me and now I understand what he was trying to tell me.\" In 2002, Newsome became the first African American to become a GM in NFL history, followed by Houston's Rick Smith in 2006, then Reese in 2007. Their legacy inspires Holmes. Newsome, whose Ravens won in 2000 and 2012, and Reese, whose Giants triumphed in 2007 and 2011, are the only ones in the group to lift the Lombardi Trophy. However, Reese sees a possible similar trajectory for Holmes, who once cut out an image of Newsome hoisting the Lombardi Trophy to his vision board as a goal, in Detroit. \"Brad really came up in an old-school way. He earned his way to the top to where he is right now,\" Reese said. \"Some guys can kind of manipulate the system with kind of a who you know kind of thing, but Brad has done it the right way, by working his way up and getting his shot.\" When the time came to fill out his staff, Holmes sought out a number of Black front-office candidates who he knew were ready for larger roles. Among them, Agnew, a former NFL player, who Holmes picked to be his assistant GM. Agnew had spent four years as the director of pro scouting with the Rams, working alongside Holmes, in addition to 18 seasons on the Rams scouting staff after his playing days ended in 2000. \"Me and him have spent a lot of late nights watching tape, trying to figure it out,\" Agnew said of working with Holmes.

For more information, click here. Holmes also tabbed Mike Martin to lead Holmes' newly created scouting advancement department in 2021 -- a unit focused on enhanced scouting in the college and pro ranks. This offseason, Martin left to accept a position as Notre Dame football's general manager. \"I just try to make sure guys are in a position to succeed,\" said Holmes, who also credits the Fritz Pollard Alliance for helping him and other minority candidates earn opportunities in coaching, front office and scouting staff roles. \"And look, they've gotta be qualified. Black, white, brown, purple ... whatever color. They've gotta be qualified and good regardless.\" As Holmes' influence grows in the Lions' front office, so will his reach across the league, according to Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive vice president of football operations, who added Holmes' and his peers' success on the field would inspire other teams to consider Black candidates the next time they are filling positions in their front office. \"They become great examples,\" Vincent said. \"So, when that time comes [during] that cycle ... he may be able to say, 'Hey, here's someone.' Or as we know, who comes from whose tree and that's a big one. Eventually, Brad will be producing his own.\" To help his tree set deeper roots, Holmes helped launch the Wally Triplett Fellowship in the fall of 2024 -- a program designed to give two minority college students the opportunity to experience professional sports and find their niche in front offices. It's named to recognize the contributions of Lions legend Wally Triplett, the first African American draftee to play for an NFL team in 1949. The program focuses on four six-month rotations to ensure that participants are exposed to different roles throughout the Lions' organization. Students Alexis Williams (Notre Dame) and Myles Gresham (Saginaw Valley State) are the two fellows working in their second year of the two-year program. The departments they've worked in include marketing, stadium events, team operations, corporate partnerships and community relations. \"It's so many paths that you can take, and it doesn't have to be just playing or coaching,\" Holmes said. \"... We need more Black [team] presidents. So, what can we do on our part to give others opportunities to become a [team] president? \"Do all these rotations to give these experiences outside of just coaching and scouting so those were some of the things we wanted to do to make sure we were giving other kids a chance.\" Holmes knows his influence extends outside of front offices as well. Many on the Lions team see his example as something to aspire to, or at least appreciate, making the relationship between the players and front office feel closer for both. \"You look at an NFL roster and the majority of it is African American players,\" Holmes said. \"So, just to be able to relate, connect with them, talk with them ... and I just think that it's good to see for younger generations. So, just as I was looking to an Ozzie Newsome and a Jerry Reese and Rick Smith, hopefully I can be that same model for that younger generation.\" According to St. Brown, the players feel a connection to Holmes beyond just football; there's a respect level that is understood inside the locker room. \"I think it's dope to be in the city of Detroit, where there's already so many Black people,\" said St. Brown, a 2021 fourth-round selection out of USC. \"It's awesome because I feel like the sports that we play, football and basketball, are predominantly Black. \"So, to have people that are in charge to be Black is awesome and especially in Detroit because there's so much culture,\" he said, \"there's so much history that comes from the city.\" A DAY 3 draft tradition continued inside the Lions' war room on April 26, when the front office honored Holmes at the Meijer Performance Center. To celebrate Holmes being announced as North Carolina A&T's commencement speaker the following May, Wood gifted team brass, including Dan Campbell and members of the front office, coaching and player personnel departments with Holmes' No. 95 college jerseys to wear while making picks that day. In 2024, they all wore matching all-black jerseys that featured Dan Campbell's Lions' No. 89. Holmes' support of HBCUs is deep-rooted, as is the bond he shares with the NFL's five other Black GMs. Despite being direct competitors at times, Holmes likes to connect with all of them. • Takeaways, questions from all games »\n• Graziano overreacts to Week 3 games »\n• Top plays » | Best, worst from fantasy »\n• Full Week 3 scoreboard » | More » \"One thing that stands out is how open and humble Brad is, even though he's in a competitive space. When I first transitioned into this role, he was one of the first people to reach out to offer encouragement and support,\" said Adofo-Mensah, whose teams are 36-18 since being hired by Minnesota in 2022. \"That meant a lot and speaks to the kind of person he is. We both are the types of competitors that want everyone to bring their best and see if our best is enough and I value that in our relationship.\" Grier and Berry could particularly relate to Holmes being tasked with turning around a franchise with a long recent history of struggles as a first-time GM. The Dolphins hadn't reached the playoffs for seven consecutive seasons before Grier took over as GM in 2016; they reached the wild-card round in his first season. Cleveland hadn't been to the playoffs since 2002 when Berry was hired ahead of the 2020 season; it reached the playoffs, and won a game, in Year 1 of his watch. \"We're all very conscious because we know we don't get these opportunities often and when they come, you know the burden, but you try to do the best job for the organization and what you're doing and representing but also know what the standard is,\" Grier said. Adofo-Mensah, who worked under Berry in Cleveland, also added that \"there's a responsibility that comes with representation, especially in a space where people who look like us haven't traditionally had many opportunities. \"It's not just about holding the position,\" Adofo-Mensah said. \"It's about doing it in a way that opens doors for others. I feel gratitude, but also a deep sense of purpose. I hope my journey helps inspire or prepare the next wave of leaders.\" Since Day 1, Holmes has been committed to doing the same. For those past and present who have witnessed his climb up the ranks, his success on and off the field is no surprise. \"I've always respected Brad's perseverance, work ethic and vision -- going far back to when he first began scouting with the Rams,\" Newsome said. \"While his merits as an evaluator are well-documented, I think it's his unique ability to inspire people and build strong culture that resonates most. \"Detroit has seen this firsthand over the past few years, and I'd expect Brad to continue making his mark on this league well into the future.\""

(0:52) Making tough lineup decisions each week can be the most challenging part of the fantasy football process. When you're torn between two similar players and simply don't know who to start, start the player with the superior matchup. Ah, but exactly how does one determine the best (and worst) weekly matchups? Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now The matchup rankings provide a schedule independent method to evaluate positional matchups each week, ranking all 32 opposing defenses in order of most to least favorable for opposing players at all four skill positions (quarterback, running back, wide receiver and tight end). Instead of relying upon seasonal totals, we calibrate points allowed data to show how each defense fared relative to the difficulty of the schedule it has faced. This provides a fairer approach to judging the quality of individual matchups. As we enter Week 4, only data from the 2025 season is used, but once six weeks are in the books, only the most recent five weeks' worth of numbers will be used. Adjusted fantasy points allowed (Adj. FPA) reflects how far above or below players' weekly PPR fantasy point averages that defenses held opponents at that position. A positive number means that the matchup is favorable. A negative number means it is unfavorable. Additionally, remember that teams often use multiple running backs and wide receivers in a game, and these plus/minus averages cover all of a team's personnel at that position. Finally, a caveat: Matchups are only one ingredient in my rankings formula. Not every favorable matchup should be exploited, nor every unfavorable matchup avoided. If you want my -- and ESPN fantasy staff's -- most complete source for whom to start and sit each week, consult our weekly rankings. Matchups highlight: Jordan Love, Green Bay Packers (at Dallas Cowboys). He and the Packers are coming off a devastating loss in Cleveland, but now they get a prime-time game in Micah Parsons' return to Dallas against one of the worst defenses in the league. Specifically against the pass, the Cowboys rank last in Total QBR allowed (79.5), yards per attempt (9.8) and Next Gen Stats' Pass EPA (40.7), and they're the only team to allow an opposing quarterback to score 24-plus fantasy points with a top-eight positional finish in each of their first three games. Others to like: Geno Smith, Las Vegas Raiders (vs. Chicago Bears) Bo Nix, Denver Broncos (vs. Cincinnati Bengals) Matchup to avoid: Dak Prescott, Cowboys (vs. Packers). Thanks in large part to his defense's struggles keeping points off the board, Prescott has been heavily used through three weeks, tying for the league's lead in dropbacks and passing attempts (49.3 and 42.0 per game). While he might shoulder a similar burden Sunday night, he'll do so without his No. 1 receiver, CeeDee Lamb, while facing one of the league's best defenses. The Packers have surrendered the fewest passing yards per attempt (4.8) and have the third-best Pass EPA (minus-27.7). \"DEF to avoid\" and \"DEF to exploit\" columns rank team defenses in terms of strength of matchup; \"Opp.\": Week 4 opponent; \"Rk\": Matchup ranking, where 1 is the toughest defense and 32 is the easiest defense to face; \"Adj. FPA\": The number of fantasy points that defense added or subtracted from its opponent. Matchups highlight: Omarion Hampton, Los Angeles Chargers (at New York Giants). Najee Harris' season-ending Achilles injury thrusts Hampton into the spotlight. Following Harris' departure midway through Week 2, Hampton played 86% of the offensive snaps and absorbed 14 of the team's 16 rushing attempts. That spike in usage aligns perfectly with a soft matchup against a Giants defense that has seen a league-high 43.8% of opponents' carries go for more yards than expected, per Next Gen Stats. Javonte Williams scored 25.0 fantasy points against this defense, playing 71% of the snaps and totaling 24 touches in Week 2. Others to like: J.K. Dobbins, Broncos (vs. Bengals) Chuba Hubbard, Carolina Panthers (at New England Patriots) Matchup to avoid: David Montgomery, Detroit Lions (vs. Cleveland Browns). He might have more rushing attempts this season than backfield mate Jahmyr Gibbs (22 to 21) and is coming off his best fantasy performance in nearly two years, but Montgomery is in for a matchups-fueled letdown in Week 4. The Browns have allowed the fewest rushing yards per carry (2.3) and have held opponents to 65 rushing yards beneath expected, the most in that direction in the league. They did that while facing a trio of running backs who averaged 15-plus fantasy points per game last season (Chase Brown, Derrick Henry, Josh Jacobs). \"DEF to avoid\" and \"DEF to exploit\" columns rank team defenses in terms of strength of matchup; \"Opp.\": Week 4 opponent; \"Rk\": Matchup ranking, where 1 is the toughest defense and 32 is the easiest defense to face; \"Adj.

Tre Tucker might have been the Raiders' Week 3 star, but Meyers remains Geno Smith's go-to guy, as Meyers' 24.5% target share leads the team (Tucker is at 19.6%). The Bears, meanwhile, have struggled mightily without two-time All-Pro CB Jaylon Johnson, surrendering the fourth-most fantasy points per game (41.3) and second-most points per target (2.48) to opposing wide receivers. That Meyers is the Raiders' usual slot receiver also benefits him facing this matchup, as the Bears' 2.49 points per target afforded slot receivers is second most in the league. Others to like: Jauan Jennings, San Francisco 49ers (vs. Jacksonville Jaguars) Keon Coleman, Buffalo Bills (vs. New Orleans Saints) Matchup to avoid: Ja'Marr Chase, Bengals (at Broncos). A player of his skill set, with the league's fourth-best target share (32.3%), and having been the No. 1 selection on average in ESPN drafts during the preseason, is practically impossible to bench. That said, Chase is without his usual quarterback, Joe Burrow, was unimpressive in Week 3 (8.9 fantasy points on six targets), and now has to tangle with Broncos CB Pat Surtain II, who allowed a combined 11.7 points on eight targets as the closest defender to Calvin Ridley, Michael Pittman Jr. and Quentin Johnston, the receivers across from whom he was most frequently aligned. Chase managed only 5.7 points on six targets with Surtain as the nearest defender in these teams' Week 17 meeting last season. \"DEF to avoid\" and \"DEF to exploit\" columns rank team defenses in terms of strength of matchup; \"Opp.\": Week 4 opponent; \"Rk\": Matchup ranking, where 1 is the toughest defense and 32 is the easiest defense to face; \"Adj.

Hunter Henry's 29.0-point Week 3 continued the Steelers' struggles against tight ends, which date back to the beginning of last season. During that time, the team has seen 12 tight ends score 10-plus points against them, one shy of the Cincinnati Bengals' league-leading total, including AJ Barner's 10.8 in Week 2. In his first game working with Carson Wentz, Hockenson scored 15.9 points on a 25% target share in Week 3, a signal that he's still involved heavily enough to capitalize upon the matchup. Matchup to avoid: Zach Ertz, Washington Commanders (at Atlanta Falcons). He's off to a hot start, with 36.8 fantasy points on an 18.2% target share, which rank seventh and 11th among tight ends. That said, he had his quietest game yet while working with fill-in Marcus Mariota in Week 3 (6.8 points on three targets), and he's now facing one of the hottest-starting defenses against the position. The Falcons held Hockenson to 2.2 points on three targets in Week 2, and for the season they've afforded the second-lowest passer rating to the position (65.7). \"DEF to avoid\" and \"DEF to exploit\" columns rank team defenses in terms of strength of matchup; \"Opp.\": Week 4 opponent; \"Rk\": Matchup ranking, where 1 is the toughest defense and 32 is the easiest defense to face; \"Adj.

    "bodyText": "Rich Eisen reacts to Adam Schefter's report that the Giants will start rookie QB Jaxson Dart over Russell Wilson in Week 4. (2:17) EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. --- The New York Giants are planning to bench quarterback Russell Wilson in favor of first-round rookie Jaxson Dart after three games, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Tuesday. Dart's first start will come at home Sunday against the undefeated Los Angeles Chargers at MetLife Stadium. The 25th overall pick this year out of Ole Miss served as the backup to Wilson for the first three games of the season. The Giants (0-3) also have veteran Jameis Winston on the roster. Giants quarterback Russell Wilson ranks 30th out of 32 qualified QBs in Total QBR this season and has been hit while running or throwing 40 times this season, tied with the Patriots' Drake Maye for the most in the NFL. Head coach Brian Daboll left open the possibility of making a change at quarterback when he said Monday afternoon that the team was \"evaluating everything\" and refused to declare Wilson the starter. Wilson struggled in Sunday night's 22-9 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. He threw for 160 yards and tossed a pair of interceptions. There was also an ugly red zone possession late in the contest where he threw the ball out of bounds on fourth down, and he was booed late in the first half after the second interception. The switch to Dart is a move that could reinvigorate a disappointed fan base. Fans cheered when the rookie came on the field for a snap in the second quarter on Sunday night. That contrasted with their booing after Wilson threw a second-quarter interception in a tie game in his first home game with the team. Dart has been preparing for this moment ever since the Giants traded back into the first round to get him to New York. He has done nothing but impress since taking the field in the spring. Dart started the spring with the third-team offense and quickly worked his way past Winston early in the summer. His first extended taste of regular-season NFL action will come against a Chargers defense that is currently allowing under 300 yards per game. Dart will give the Giants' offense a different look and more options. His ability to run the ball and the zone-read had his version of the offense looking vastly different from the first-team unit with Wilson throughout the summer."

    "bodyText": "Stephen A. Smith and Dan Orlovsky get into a heated debate over the Cowboys' embarrassing loss to the Bears. (2:45) Sacking Dak Prescott would be bittersweet for Micah Parsons. The two-time All-Pro pass rusher downplayed his upcoming return to Dallas and expressed his feelings about potentially taking down his friend and former teammate in a conversation with The Associated Press on Tuesday. Parsons and the Green Bay Packers (2-1) face off against Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys (1-2) in front of a national television audience on Sunday night. \"It's going to be painful,\" Parsons told the AP about getting a chance to sack Prescott. \"That's my guy. He was always like a good mentor for me. But you know how it is. He always told me if I ever faced him that it'll be a great matchup, so I'm excited to see what Sunday brings itself.\" Parsons plans to treat it like an ordinary game, though it'll be his first time inside AT&T Stadium as a visitor. \"I accepted my fate weeks ago when the trade happened,\" Parsons said. \"So, for me, it's just all about playing another game and just doing what I do best, and that's just be a disruptive football player. I think the media and the fans are trying to blow it up to be such a big thing. But I just look at it as just another game at AT&T.\" Just a game that was circled on everyone's calendar after Cowboys owner Jerry Jones traded Parsons to the Packers one week before the NFL's season opener, ending a lengthy contract dispute. The Packers increased their Super Bowl hopes with Parsons and made the 26-year-old the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history by signing him to a four-year, $188 million contract that includes $136 million guaranteed. The Cowboys (1-2) have struggled without Parsons, especially on defense. They've allowed the third-most yards (397.7 per game), most passing yards (288) and sixth-highest points (30.7). Despite missing all of training camp and arriving in Green Bay a week before the first game, Parsons made an immediate impact on defense in a 27-13 win over the two-time defending NFC North champion Detroit Lions in Week 1. The Packers defeated the Washington Commanders soundly 27-18 four days later. But the offense couldn't get on track in a 13-10 loss at the Cleveland Browns in Week 3. \"Besides the fans, just the teammates, the support staff, I mean they made this transition so great and I'm just extremely honored and blessed to be with such a great group of guys that want to win and that just want to play football and I think we've been playing really good football so far, so that helps and I just hope we continue that,\" Parsons said."
