    "bodyText": "NFL.com Analyst The first three weeks of the 2025 NFL season have been rough on running backs. Washington's Austin Ekeler (Achilles), Arizona's James Conner (ankle) and the Los Angeles Chargers' Najee Harris (Achilles) all sustained season-ending injuries, while New York Giants' Tyrone Tracy Jr. suffered a dislocated shoulder Sunday night, which will force him to miss some time. This all means we could see some backs on the move ahead of the NFL trade deadline on Tuesday, Nov. 4. To get a sense of who might be gone by November, I scanned all 32 NFL rosters looking at factors like team competitiveness, depth charts, contract status and player performance. Below are the five running backs who stood out to me as potential trade targets. Let's start making some calls, GMs! There was speculation back in August that the Jets could potentially trade Hall, but head coach Aaron Glenn dismissed the notion and said they would utilize all three of their RBs -- Hall and 2024 draft picks \bBraelon Allen\b and Isaiah Davis. Three weeks into the season, OC Tanner Engstrand has indeed spread the rock around, and New York's run game is one of the few bright spots, ranking ninth in rush yards and rush TDs. Hall leads the team in carries (38) and rush yards (157) -- but has yet to get into the end zone -- while Allen and Davis have combined for just 16 attempts. Most of the other carries have gone to quarterbacks \bJustin Fields\b, who missed Week 3 with a concussion, and \bTyrod Taylor\b. Little has gone well so far for the 2025 Jets, who dwell in the AFC East cellar alongside the also winless Dolphins. Hall is in the final year of his rookie contract and knows he's not the new regime's guy. His potential departure in the coming weeks would allow Allen and Davis to take on bigger roles in Engstrand's offense and net New York some quality draft capital, as well. Hall is a big back who can do everything asked of him as a rusher and receiver out of the backfield. In fact, the fourth-year pro sits second on the Jets in targets (13), receptions (eight) and receiving yards (78). There are a ton of teams that could use RB help right now -- Bears, Cardinals, Chargers, Chiefs, Commanders, Steelers and Vikings among them -- and Hall, whose best days I believe are ahead of him, would be an asset almost anywhere. Kamara has made it known he wants to play for the Saints and the Saints alone. The five-time Pro Bowl running back has been the focal point of New Orleans' offense since he was drafted in 2017, and he's been incredibly steady despite all of the offensive changes during his nine seasons. The 30-year-old still brings great value as a dual-threat running back who defenses must account for on every play. Unfortunately, no matter how great Kamara still is, he can't stack up wins for New Orleans (0-3) without a lot more help. The Saints are in full rebuild mode -- they could very well be in the quarterback market once again next offseason -- and need as many assets as they can get. Kamara's trade value might not be nearly as high as it once was, but by moving the experienced playmaker, New Orleans would pick up draft capital and free up some cap space. The team that should seriously consider calling GM Mickey Loomis? Kansas City. Kamara could be the answer to many of the Chiefs' offensive problems. Teams don't usually want to part with young, versatile playmakers like Achane. But if things continue to go sideways down in South Beach, and rookie Ollie Gordon II keeps building on his early promise, dealing Achane could become more palatable for Miami's front office. The third-year pro routinely flashes speed between the tackles and after the catch, leading all RBs in targets (110), receptions (96), receiving yards (733) and receiving TDs (8) since 2024. Like Hall and Kamara, the do-it-all back undoubtedly would be an asset for multiple playoff contenders, including the Chiefs, Cardinals and Commanders -- if the Fins are open to a trade. It's no secret the 0-3 Titans are still a work-in-progress. Rookie quarterback Cam Ward is still getting his feet wet as a pro, and head coach Brian Callahan just handed over play-calling duties to quarterbacks coach Bo Hardegree. Although Tennessee would surely miss Pollard's steady presence, dealing the veteran -- who's on pace for a career-best rushing total and whose contract includes zero guaranteed money in 2026 -- might make sense long-term. The Titans would likely want to hold off on making a move at least until \bTyjae Spears\b returns to the lineup. Spears, who began the season on IR due to a preseason ankle injury, is capable of shouldering a large load beyond his typical third-down duties. I'll admit there are a few factors working against a potential Etienne trade. First off, despite the offseason trade chatter, Etienne has thrived in Jacksonville's new offense and ranks third in the NFL in rushing yards (270) through three weeks. And second, the Jags already traded one of their backs, Tank Bigsby, to Philadelphia earlier this season. But everyone has a price. If Jacksonville is willing to listen to offers and, in turn, ends up moving Etienne (a free agent in 2026), the team will still have a pair of young running backs who have showed promise. Rookies Bhayshul Tuten and LeQuint Allen Jr. could be the future of Liam Coen's backfield, with Tuten flashing some major potential already as a runner and pass catcher.\bDo the Jags think their 2025 fourth-round pick is ready for RB1 duties? If yes, Etienne could be available. With the NFL season set to kick off, Maurice Jones-Drew reveals his picks for the top 10 leading rushers of 2025. Will Saquon Barkley earn back-to-back rushing titles? Which rookies make his list? With the ground game back in vogue, Maurice Jones-Drew ranks all 32 RB1s heading into the 2025 NFL season.

Where does veteran Josh Jacobs land after an impressive first campaign in Green Bay? Does Giants rookie Tyrone Tracy Jr. crack the top 25?
